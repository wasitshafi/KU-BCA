		<h3>Kashmir -Paradise on earth.</h3>
  	    <p>About kashmir</p>
	</hgroup>
  </header>	
	<p>Kashmir is one of the top most visited places in india.The worldwide importance of electronic print processes is constantly increasing. The growth of multi color ink-jet technology is especially growing for the home and office markets 1. A large and growing consumer market for ink jet has become noticed in packaging, publication, and specialty areas. The quality of ink jet printing is influenced by the printers in use as well, as by the physico-chemical properties of printing ink and print substrate. To mention a few, these interactions are influenced by interfacial charges, wettability, and adsorption phenomena. An ink-jet recording sheet comprises a support such as paper, at least one ink-receiving layer on the support, and a glossproviding layer formed on the ink-receiving layer. The inkreceiving layer consists essentially of a pigment and a binder 2-5. The gloss-providing layer consists of a pigment and a synthetic polymer formed from a latex or water soluble polymer as a binde </p>
	
	<p>Peoples of kashmir are very friendly and Roughness, or smoothness, of paper is a very important property for print quality. Surface roughness is usually divided into microscale and macroscale components7,8. Although there is not total agreement on the boundary between those two, the macroscale component consists of features larger than 10 µm and is usually due to poor fiber dispersion, ionic destabilization or flocculation, roughness of base paper, or insufficient coating or calendaring. The microscale component consists of features considerably smaller than 10µm, due to pigment particle size distribution, particle shape, binder type, film shrinkage, drying condition, coating holdout, and coating weight5. Research groups studying the roughness and its effect on gloss agreed upon the fact that common roughness numbers are insufficient to predict gloss8. It sometimes occurs that the rougher surfaces have higher gloss. From the classical roughness measuring methods, the Parker Print-Surf (PPS)9 method has been widely used in paper and printing industries because of the possibility of measuring roughness at different pressures, from 500 to 2000 kPa, to mimic the conditions at a printing nip. The PPS tester uses a contact air-leak principle, measuring air flow between substrate in a 51µm wide ring. It recalculates the airflow into a mean gap between the surface and the flat circular land pressed against it9. The measurement obtained from all air-leak instruments is called macro-roughness. One key disadvantage is that these instruments lack the sensitivity to measure on a scale small enough to be relevant to printing. For example, a half-tone dot can range from 20 to 60µm in diameter. Various air-leak measurements can span widths ranging from 51 to 13,500 µm10. Therefore, the need for measuring micro-roughness is growing. Surface characterization using atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been reported recently11-13. AFM was invented by Binnig 14, and introduced in 1985 by Binnig, Quate, and Gerber, as an offshoot from the scanning tunneling microscope 15 (STM).Since then, AFM has rapidly developed into a powerful and invaluable surface analysis technique on both micro- and nanoscale. The sample surface is scanned with a sharp tip mounted on a cantilever. The small deflections of the cantilever are measured using a focused laser beam, which is reflected off the cantilever to a photodiode detector. The x, y, z piezoelectric scanner located under the sample provides the precise movement of the sample. The variation in voltage signals from the photodiode detector as a function of probe position is converted into a 3D image by image processing system16. The tapping mode in AFM was developed especially for studying soft and fragile samples. Instead of dragging the tip across the surface in the conventional contact mode, the tapping mode is done by oscillating the cantilever with a frequency of few hundred kilohertz near its resonance. The oscillation and the force on the sample are maintained constant by a feedback loop. The tip is brought close to the surface until it begins to touch the surface by tapping it gently. While scanning the surface, the amplitude alternates depending on the topography. No lateral, shear, or friction force is applied to the sample and no sticking occurs, since the tip contacts the surface briefly during each oscillations17. Therefore, tapping mode AFM is suitable for studying paper samples. Newer methods for measuring micro-roughness are the stylus profilometer 18 and laser profilometer 19. A stylus profilometer uses a preloaded fine cone-shaped stylus dragged across the surface. The vertical movement of the stylus compresses a piezoelectric element, which generates a fairly linear voltage response. The stylus profilometer is widely used to characterize the surface roughness of metals. When it is applied to paper, the stylus traces could be observed depending on the conditions of stylus radius and load, and the surface hardness of paper18. It was found that careful selection of stylus radius and load conditions can ensure no permanent damage of paper surface. The newer laser profilometer uses a monochromatic laser light source. It is a non-contact method so there is no damage to the paper surface 1</p>
	
	<p>Kashimr has all the four seasons viz:summer,spring,autmu,winter. the most visited places are Some gloss values for Glossy paper and High Gloss were out of the measurement range at one or the other angles  but are presented just for comparison reasons. he 750 angle appears the most suitable for comparison of all the substrates in this experiment. The correlation of PPS roughness and paper gloss is low, reaching 72.2%. EMVECO profilometer and AFM showed higher correlations (88.0% and 86.4%). Interestingly, both Kodak papers are rougher than Epson Glossy paper, but have much higher gloss values, especially High Gloss paper. According to Fresnel theory5,24, The gloss of paper is determined by the incident angle of light, incident light wavelength, and refractive index and the surface roughness of the paper. For an instrument of defined incident angle of light and wavelength, the gloss is determined by the refractive index and surface roughness of the paper. In this experiment, the wavelength and angle of incident light was the same for all the samples. Therefore, the reason probably was that Kodak paper has coating layer with higher refractive index than Epson papers. The correlation of roughness to print gloss is higher than to paper gloss with all three methods. The test method with highest correlation of nearly 100% to print gloss is AFM with the Photo 2200 printer. AFM and stylus profilometer both have high correlation to print gloss with all three printers, and PPS only has low correlation with the Pro 5000 printer. Ink jet printing is non-impact printing, not like the classical printing processes with contact pressure, so the ink film surface topography depends on paper surface. Since the ink is the same for the same printer, the refractive index of each ink film is the same for all the samples. Therefore, the print gloss value is more determined by the surface roughness.</p>
