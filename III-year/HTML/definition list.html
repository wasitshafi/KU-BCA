	<dt><b>1.General Register Organization:</b><dt>
	<dd><tt>When a large number of registers are included in the CPU, it is most efficient to connect them through a common bus system. The registers communicate with each other not only for direct data transfers, but also while performing various micro-operations. Hence it is necessary to provide a common unit that can perform all the arithmetic, logic and shift micro-operation in the processor.</tt></dd>

	<dt><b>2.Control Word:</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>There are 14 binary selection inputs in the units, and their combined value specified a control word. It consists of four fields three fields contain three bits each, and one field has five bits. The three bits of SEL A select a source register for the A input of the ALU. The three bits of SEL B select a source register for the B input of the ALU. The three bit of SEC D select a destination register using the decoder and its seven load outputs. The five bits of OPR select one of the operations in the ALU. The 14-bit control word when applied to the selection inputs specify a particular micro-operation. </tt></dd>

	<dt><b>3.Addressing Modes</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>The operation field of an instruction specifies the operation to be performed. This operation must be executed on some data stored in computer register as memory words. The way the operands are chosen during program execution is dependent on the addressing mode of the instruction. The addressing mode specifies a rule for interpreting or modifying the address field of the instruction between the operand is activity referenced. Computer use addressing mode technique for the purpose of accommodating one or both of the following provisions. </tt></dd>

	<dt><b>4.Pipelining</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>Pipelining is a technique of decomposing a sequential process into sub-operation with each sub-process being executed in a special dedicated segment that operator concurrently with all other segment. A pipeline can be visualized as a collection of processing segments through which binary information flows. Each segment performs partial processing dictated by the way the task is portioned. The result obtained from the computation in each segment is transferred to next segment in the pipeline. The final result is obtained after the data have passed through all segments. 
	</tt></dd>

	<dt><b>5.Instruction pipeline</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>Pipeline processing can occurs not only in the data stream, but in the instruction stream as well. An Instruction pipeline reads consecutive instruction from memory while previous instruction one being executed in other segments. This causes the instruction fetch & execute phase to overlap and perform simultaneous operations. </tt></dd>

	<dt><b>6.Data Independence</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>This brings us to our next topic: data independence. It is the property of the database which tries to ensure that if we make any change in any level of schema of the database, the schema immediately above it would require minimal or no need of change. 
	What does this mean? We know that in a building, each floor stands on the floor below it. If we change the design of any one floor, e.g. extending the width of a room by demolishing the western wall of that room, it is likely that the design in the above floors will have to be changed also. As a result, one change needed in one particular floor would mean continuing to change the design of each floor until we reach the top floor, with an increase in the time, cost and labour. Would not life be easy if the change could be contained in one floor only? Data independence is the answer for this. It removes the need for additional amount of work needed in adopting the single change into all the levels above. </tt></dd>
