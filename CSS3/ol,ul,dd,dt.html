    <dt><b>1.General Register Organization:</b><dt>
	<dd>When a large number of registers are included in the CPU, it is most efficient to connect them through a common bus system. The registers communicate with each other not only for direct data transfers, but also while performing various micro-operations. Hence it is necessary to provide a common unit that can perform all the arithmetic, logic and shift micro-operation in the processor.</dd>

	<dt><b>2.Control Word:</b></dt>
	<dd>There are 14 binary selection inputs in the units, and their combined value specified a control word. It consists of four fields three fields contain three bits each, and one field has five bits. The three bits of SEL A select a source register for the A input of the ALU. The three bits of SEL B select a source register for the B input of the ALU. The three bit of SEC D select a destination register using the decoder and its seven load outputs. The five bits of OPR select one of the operations in the ALU. The 14-bit control word when applied to the selection inputs specify a particular micro-operation.</dd>

	<dt><b>3.Addressing Modes</b></dt>
	<dd>The operation field of an instruction specifies the operation to be performed. This operation must be executed on some data stored in computer register as memory words. The way the operands are chosen during program execution is dependent on the addressing mode of the instruction. The addressing mode specifies a rule for interpreting or modifying the address field of the instruction between the operand is activity referenced. Computer use addressing mode technique for the purpose of accommodating one or both of the following provisions.</dd>
